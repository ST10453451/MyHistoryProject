A REPORT FOR MY HISTORY APPLICATION

Summary

Creating this application for my assignment had its own challenges, but I was able to manage. At first, the app did not display the results when i entered the age, but i was able to make it work eventually. 

I am also having trouble getting the constraints right, even after inferring all at the same time but the app is fuctioning properly, handling the inputs and outputs perfectly.

The purpose of the app is to allow users to enter their age, then get the name of the historical figure who died at the same age as the one entered. If the user's age does not match any age from the database, there will be an output saying there's no age that matches the one entered. Also, if the age entered is out of the required range (20-100) the user will get an output to enetr a valid age. Overall, thois was a fun experience and i've learnt a lot about creating an app on android studio. I was worried about the fact that we need to utilize Github, since i've been having trouble understing it and pushing my projects there; but i was able to fifnd out how to do so and i can finally say my app has been pushed to Github and submittting my assignment should not br a problem.
